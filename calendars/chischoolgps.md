There are 5 calendars

- CSG Preschool Calendar
- CSG Public Elementary Calendar
- CSG Private Elementary Calendar
- CSG Public High School Calendar
- CSG Private High School Calendar

There are all kinds of OH (Open House) and tour events. On a typical day there
are 5 to 6 schools having OH at different hours. Remember [Google
Calendar](GoogleCalendar) can import all or some of the calendars. It can also
allow user to toggle calendars on/off at any time.
