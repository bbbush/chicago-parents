A list of event sources for parenting.

Each event source may need login, and may provide its own calendar. Due to the large
amount of information, a new calendar is necessary to provide only "featured" events.
That is to say, create more event sources. This is how IT industry works!

What can be added is the convenience of following instructions without much thinking.
NPN does a good job on this, its event calendar is helpful and easy and include coupons
that one must rush to apply. This is better than a plain list in a thousand ways. That
said, people collect things. More, technical people reverse engineer things.
